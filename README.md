# WorkSafe_CV
- A locally hosted model using pretrained YOLOv11 model where you are able to enter an input image and retrieve the PPE that is being worn.
- Dataset used: Roboflow PPE detection dataset, containing 1126 Images for training and 8 classes of PPE.
- Test Set has 161 Images for testing.
- Image size is 640x640

## Running the Program:
1. This is a test program on running YOLO models for PPE detection using the Roboflow PPE detection dataset which contains 8 classes of PPE that can be classified and detected with bounding boxes. 
2. Yolov5 model will not be displayed in this repository, however The weights recieved from he model will be avaliable in the repository.
